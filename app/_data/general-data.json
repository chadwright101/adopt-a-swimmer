        "quote": "I loved being underwater. It was one of the best parts of the day. I also enjoyed playing with the other children. Floating on my own was fun because I could move around the water without anyone holding me. I felt really proud of myself! When I go underwater, I like to blow bubbles and relax. I dream of being in the Olympics someday and swimming all by myself. The boat trip was amazing too! I’ll never forget seeing the dolphins following us and the seals on the mountain.",

To see how the children’s relationship with water changes over time as they grow more and more confident is life-changing. Whenever I think about AAS I feel overwhelmingly blessed to have had the opportunity to impact the swimmers’ lives and experience their joy in the water. ",

As someone who’s always had a strong connection to the water, sharing my love for it with the brave and passionate kids in the program has been an absolute joy. AAS is truly one of a kind, and I feel incredibly blessed to be part of it. From witnessing their first strokes to seeing their confidence soar, every moment spent with these amazing kids reinforces the value of this experience. ",

        "quote": "The patience, care and never-ending belief of Louise in each of the pupils is something I strive towards. Her ability to understand the needs and skill level of each individual, teach them how to swim, and foster a love for water is remarkable. There have been many moments of joy in the pool. One that I will cherish forever was when a new pupil who had never been in a pool before climbed into the water fearful and uncertain. Once a noodle was fastened around his waist and he realized he was able to float, he burst out laughing in disbelief; a laughter of pure enjoyment from deep within. His fear faded, and this youngster has made immense progress with swimming. It is a genuine privilege to work alongside Louise, the legacy of AAS is great and has changed many lives.  ",
