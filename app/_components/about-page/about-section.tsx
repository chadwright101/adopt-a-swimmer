          <p>
            In 2011, Louise Auersberg founded Adopt a Swimmer, a non-profit
            organisation in Plettenberg Bay, as a way to help children at risk
            and facing economic disadvantages. Louiseâ€™s own struggles dealing
            with a learning disability and facing many obstacles inspired her to
            use water as a conduit for healing. For Louise, swimming is a
            powerful metaphor for facing challenges head on and pushing through
            adversity. She realised she could take her love for water and
            helping children and combine them.
