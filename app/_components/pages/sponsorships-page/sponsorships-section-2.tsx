            qualified coaching staff. These individuals play a pivotal role in
            teaching, coaching, and guiding the students through their swimming
            journey. It is essential to note that our coaches are highly
            qualified and undergo annual continued professional development to
            stay informed about the latest techniques and technologies in
            swimming instruction.

            Recognising the unique challenges faced by underprivileged children,
            we understand the importance of providing reliable transportation. A
            portion of funds are allocated to cover the costs associated with
            collecting the students from their respective homes and ensuring
            their safe return after each session. This not only enhances
            accessibility to our program but also ensures the well-being and
            safety of the children involved.

            <span className="font-semiBold">Equipment:</span> A percentage of
            funding enables us to purchase essential equipment needed to conduct
            swimming lessons such as kick boards, flippers, and noodles. These
            items are essential for beginner swimmers to gain confidence and
            coordination in the water.
